# MyBank
MyBank: simple toy app to teach through a hands-on experience modern cloud information technologies to CxOs (specifically in the Banking Industry)
MyBank is key to desmitify IT for non-technical people using domain specific language (i.e. Financial/Business Terminology).

MyBank focus on learning (experience) the essentials modern IT concepts from the perspective of a brand new agile team in charge to develop and operate an innovative portfolio of digital data-driven products/services for a potential DX-disrupted company.

MyBank embrace Digital Transformation (DX) factors (trends, assumptions) with high odds to disrupt traditional Banking incumbents:
  - Macrotrends:
    - (R&D + Marketing) $ over (Production + Distribution) $ 
    - Demand Aggregation over Offer Aggregation
    - Huge subserved (CX) users from Traditional Banking 
  - Team Imperatives:
    - Customer Experience (CX) as Ultimate Competitive Advantange (profitable niche demand aggregation)
    - Data + Internet over Physical
    - Trust + Agility over Control
    - Culture + People over Processes + Machines

Domain Model
------------
### Essential Services (Functions):
    OpenAccount(<email>) : creates a new Account 
    { 
      Id: <guid>, //[auto-generated]
      Balance: 0, //Default
      Status: Active, //Default
      UserId: <email>, //[given]
      UserKey: <secret> //[auto-generated]
    }
    ShowAccount(<accountId>, <secret>) : gets Account's details
    { 
      Id: <accountId>, 
      Balance: 0, 
      Status: Active, 
      UserId: <email>
    }
    DepositToAccount(<accountId>, <ammount>, <secret>, <token>): credits Account's balance by given ammount
    { 
      Id: <accountId>, 
      Balance: <currentBalance> + <ammount>
    }
    WithdrawFromAccount(<accountId>, <ammount>, <secret>): debits Account's balance by given ammount
    { 
      Id: <accountId>, 
      Balance: <currentBalance> - <ammount>
      Token: <token>
    }
    CloseAccount(<accountId>, <secret>) : deactivate an existing Account
    { 
      Id: <accountId>, 
      Status: Inactive //set Status to Inactive
    }
    
### Essential Concepts (Data):
    - Account:
      - Id: <guid>
      - Balance : 0 (default) | <number> > 0
      - Status : Active (default) | Inactive
      - UserId : <guid> | <email>
      - UserKey : <secret>
    - Token: Unique authenticable value representation (i.e. Bank Check)

### Business Critical Success Factors (Assumptions/Warranties):
    - MyBank is able to authenticate all user's request using a secret
      - The secret is known exclusively by the User
    - Cannot withdraw > Balance
    - Deposit requires a valid Token representing the Credited ammount
    - Withdraw returns a valid Token representing the Debited ammount
    - Tokens are Payable and Receivable goods for MyBank
    - Tokens are unique and cannot be duplicated
